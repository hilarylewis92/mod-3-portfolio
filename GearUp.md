[Building Understanding](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

* What are some takeaways from the articles?
It is interesting how our culture is so unaware of their comments and how they effect others around them. The more I read about this, the more frustrated I get because I receive and experience this stuff daily. I see it so much in day to day life that it just becomes normal and I can't always pin point when it is happening.

* How does this information change or reinforce what you thought about the topic of micro-aggressions at the outset of this session?
I am realizing that micro-aggression is sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional. There are a lot of micro-aggressive language within our culture that is consistent and hard to break free from or speak up against.

* What questions do you still have about this topic and how it relates to your life?
How do I know if I am being micro-aggressive and how to can fix that? How do I respond to someone who is being micro-aggressive to me?
