## Feedback for Matt

It was great working with Matt on my first Redux project because he had a really good working knowledge on how Redux worked. He had the idea to work on the entire project together and it ended up being the best group project experience I have had yet because I learned the most from working on each problem together. We collaborated and shared ideas very well but I would suggest that Matt takes into considerations others ideas and potentially allowing implementation of those ideas more often. Matt did very well at leading the group and making sure each of us knew every single line of code he developed on his own. Matt has a lot to offer a company considering he is a good teacher, leader, teammate, and hard worker.

## Feedback for Chelsea

I always enjoy working with Chelsea because she works very efficiently through problems. Chelsea came into the project having a limited understanding of Redux and she was able to logically share her ideas on setting up components and reducers. I enjoyed Chelsea's willingness to help me on tests when I was getting frustrated by suggesting that we Screenhero and she worked through the problems with me. Chelsea has a lot to bring to a team because of her teamwork, eye for design, understanding of user experience, and positive attitude.

## Feedback for Dale

Through this project, I appreciate that Dale encouraged the team to take a good amount of time at the beginning of the project to organize, set up waffle, and communicate how we were going to execute our project. I would suggest that Dale study the syntax for components and functions in order to have a more efficient workflow. Although Dale's workflow was slower than usual, I admire Dale's determination to learn Vim during this project. Dale had a lot of good ideas on how to set up components and reducers. Overall, Dale has a lot to offer a team in terms of effective troubleshooting, teamwork, organization, and effective communication.
